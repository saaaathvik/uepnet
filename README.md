# uepnet
UEPNet is an Input Complexity-Aware Dynamic Structured Pruning framework for autonomous driving. It uses an Upfront Exit Predictor to determine optimal network depth before inference, eliminating sequential overhead. Includes implementations for CIFAR-10 classification and BDD100K object detection using PyTorch and YOLOv8.
